Last Monday, I had the pleasure of attending a talk given by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) at [LondonR](https://www.londonr.org/), which was held at one of their usual venues at the UCL Darwin Lecture Theatre.

For most readers of this blog, Hadley needs no introduction; the running joke amongst R users that if **tidyverse** hadnâ€™t been rebranded it wouldâ€™ve been known as the *hadleyverse* says it all. I had really looked forward to this event, as itâ€™s always an interesting experience to meet in real life these people you seem to know so well or have heard so much about *virtually*. Another occasion I could recall was Hilary Parker's keynote address at EARL, which I know her through her brilliant data science podcast (co-hosted with Roger Peng) [Not So Standard Deviations](http://nssdeviations.com/).

In this post, Iâ€™m going to briefly `summarize()` (sorry `r emo::ji("laughing")`) what Hadley covered in his talk, and some of my thoughts on what he said. (potential spoiler alert?!)

## Tidyverse: the greatest hits

```{r tidyverse, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://martinctc.github.io/blog/images/IMG_8039.jpg")
```

This was perhaps the busiest LondonR sessions Iâ€™ve ever been to, but understandably so! The lecture hall usually has a fair number of free seats left, but on this occasion late-comers struggled to find free seats. Speaking to others around me, nobody seemed to know what Hadleyâ€™s talk was going to be about, mysteriously. Apparently this is a brand new talk by Hadley, titled _Tidyverse: the greatest hits_.

Interestingly, this turned out to be one of those attention-catching titles - what Hadley really planned to talk about was the greatest _mistakes_ of the tidyverse. As he claims, whilst the intuitive expectation of good developers and R coders may be that they make fewer mistakes, itâ€™s more the case for him that he makes _many_ mistakes _as fast as possible_ - which, I imagine, is partly responsible for his prolific body of work in R. Unfortunately, some of these "mistakes" have become "permanent" within tidyverse, which in his talk he explained the certain things some of us R users have questioned when using **tidyverse** packages.

```{r masking, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://martinctc.github.io/blog/images/masking-filter-lag.PNG")
```

Hadley mentioned a number of these "permanent mistakes", and probably two of those which tidyverse users resonated the most with are:

1. the conflicting function names with `stats::filter()` and `stats::lag()`
2. the use of the `+` operator rather than `%>%` in **ggplot2**

In the first case, it is the classic programming "problem" of naming variables / functions. You may think a variable name is intuitive or sensible initially, but not thinking it through can sometimes come back and bite you in the future. Hadley's argument for choosing `filter()` as the dplyr verb for filtering rows despite the existence of `stats::filter()` is because of the relatively niche applications of the latter function. The documentation of `stats::filter()` goes:

> Applies linear filtering to a univariate time series or to each series separately of a multivariate time series.

I've never used `stats::filter()` myself and personally find `filter()` to be quite an intuitive verb, so I'm not too much bothered by this one. Another similar function-naming "mistake" that Hadley talked about is the lack of intuitiveness of `gather()` and `spread()`, where it isn't immediately clear to an unfamiliar **tidyr** user which of those functions converts data from long to wide format, and vice versa. Unlike `dplyr::filter()` where there are no plans for a new filtering / subsetting function, in the developmental version of **tidyr** [there will be two new functions for pivoting data frames](https://www.r-bloggers.com/pivoting-data-frames-just-got-easier-thanks-to-pivot_wide-and-pivot_long/), `pivot_wide()` and `pivot_long()`, which remove the ambiguity you get in `spread()` and `gather()`. Note that there isn't any intent to deprecate `spread()` and `gather()`, but I think you simply get two new alternatives which make code easier to read and use.

The other interesting mistake that Hadley talked about is the `+` operator in **ggplot2**. To put it simply, this refers to the problem that whilst the rest of the **tidyverse** uses the pipe operator `%>%` to chain analysis steps together, **ggplot2** alone uses a different operator. Here's a simple illustration of the problem:

```{r message=TRUE, warning=TRUE, results="hide"}
iris %>% # You can pipe
  select(Species, Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width) %>% # Still piping
  ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, colour = Species)) + # You cannot use pipe here
  geom_point()
```

If you do not use the `+` operator once you start to use the ggplot arguments, you get the following error message:

> Error: `mapping` must be created by `aes()` Did you use %>% instead of +?

This is very much a mistake of _legacy_, because the magrittr pipe `%>%` was not in use when **ggplot2** was written. Again, this feels like a quirk or inconvenience that **tidyverse** users will need to live with, but from a macro perspective **ggplot2** is still a fantastic package with powerful functionality that played a significant role in popularising the use of R.

Hannah Frick from Mango Solutions lists a couple more "mistakes" that Hadley mentioned during his talk:
