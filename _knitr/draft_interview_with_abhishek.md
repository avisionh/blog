## Data Chats: From Physics student to Analytics Consultant

## Introduction

How do you begin a career in analytics and data science? How do you get into R? 

I have the pleasure of speaking with Abhishek Modi this week, to find out about his journey from a Physics student to an Analytics Consultant at Deloitte. 

### About Abhishek

[INSERT SHORT BIO]

Abhishek is a Consultant at Deloitte, based in Bangalore, India. 

## Interview with Abhishek Modi

**To start, could you tell me a bit about what you currently do, and what is your background?**

I did Bachelors and Masters in Physics where my interest was in the design of particle accelerators and even my master thesis was on the same! During the dissertation period, I explored a lot of fields within and outside Physics. During this time, I came across FiveThreeEight and was surprised at how accurate predictions were made in 2008 US elections. This led to my desire to interview for data analytics companies at an entry level and soon I got an offer from one.

Now after 4 years, I am working as a Consultant for Deloitte in their Analytics and Cognitive team based in Bangalore, India. My toolbox containts R, SQL, and Excel for 99% of the tasks.

**That’s interesting, especially that you were motivated by an application of analytics in politics, as opposed to physics! Tell me about when you were first introduced to R - did you come across this during your degree? Did you have any prior background in programming?**

I started learning with the traditional approach first and then started with with the tidyverse. This made me realize the difference between the two and how one can achieve same outcome using multiple outcomes. In the traditional approach, I always think in terms of what data type this function is going to provide me whether logical array, or an index. This helps to decide how to nest the functions.
While with tidyverse output, I imagine what each verb does to the dataset and then how to process the chain of sequence using the pipe operator.

Learning R has been fun for me since I can obtain the same outcome using multiple ways!

**That’s super interesting, and chimes very well with my own experience with learning R, i.e. starting with base, then discovering tidyverse, and then learning data.table for tasks that are more performance-demanding.**

**I always find it very interesting how people use R in very different ways. I personally started using R for its text mining capabilities, and I know some people for web-scraping. What do you use R for on the day to day? What packages do you use, apart from the obvious ones (tidyverse)?**

In my day to day life, I use R for everything starting from data cleaning, visualization, data wrangling, and to create models! I use ggplot2, caret, ts (for timeseries) apart from the usual ones.
