## Interview with Abhishek Modi

**To start, could you tell me a bit about what you currently do, and what is your background?**

I did Bachelors and Masters in Physics where my interest was in the design of particle accelerators and even my master thesis was on the same! During the dissertation period, I explored a lot of fields within and outside Physics. During this time, I came across FiveThreeEight and was surprised at how accurate predictions were made in 2008 US elections. This led to my desire to interview for data analytics companies at an entry level and soon I got an offer from one.

Now after 4 years, I am working as a Consultant for Deloitte in their Analytics and Cognitive team based in Bangalore, India. My toolbox containts R, SQL, and Excel for 99% of the tasks.

**Thatâ€™s interesting, especially that you were motivated by an application of analytics in politics, as opposed to physics! Tell me about when you were first introduced to R - did you come across this during your degree? Did you have any prior background in programming?**
