<section class="main-content">
<p>Whenever I’m asked the question of what is my <em>favourite</em> R package, I often go through this reasoning: tidyverse packages, such as <strong>dplyr</strong> and <strong>tidyr</strong>, are what I’d call “essentials” i.e. packages that I would always load for almost every piece of analysis in R. I love tidyverse, but when we are talking about a <em>favourite</em> package, they do not feel quite like the right candidates. The reason is because tidyverse packages are so intrinsic to my personal routine of using R that it’s almost like saying “Water is my favourite drink because I can’t live without it.” Plus, answering that tidyverse is my favourite package feels like I’m not putting much of an effort in the answer at all!</p>
<p>Other candidates include useful “specialist” packages, like <strong>tidytext</strong> and <strong>tm</strong> for text mining, <strong>mschart</strong> and <strong>officer</strong> for manipulating Office documents, as well as <strong>shinydashboard</strong> and <strong>flexdashboard</strong> for creating either dynamic or static dashboard outputs. But that doesn’t make the decision easy either - I love how each of these packages work so well for the purpose that they are designed for, and most of these are very well-maintained, documented, with plenty of vignettes (some have entire books written around the package) for users to follow through examples. You can’t compare them based on “value added” either, as the value they add to a workflow does depend entirely on what you are trying to achieve in an analysis or output.</p>
<p>The final approach that I usually take is what one could describe as a test on <em>emotive impact</em>, i.e. <em>which package, in my experience of learning to do things with R, made the largest impression on me?</em></p>
<p>Now, this question is much easier to answer because the condition is relaxed on the performance, quality, and the use-value of the package, and more focussed around my personal experience with the package in the past.</p>
