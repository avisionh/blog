<p>This is my first ever time creating a blog post using only RMarkdown. I used a template from the package called <code>prettyjekyll</code>, which was fairly straightforward. A lot of the styling and code is borrowed from Florian Privé, where you can check out his Github account at <a href="https://github.com/privefl" class="uri">https://github.com/privefl</a>.</p>
